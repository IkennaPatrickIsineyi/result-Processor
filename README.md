# Result Processing System

A Flutter project aimed at generating well formatted Excel spreadsheet file using the data of the students inputted by the user.

This project is 100% self-contained without any remote server connections.

A Dart implementation of SQLite is the database powering this project.

This project was built to the specification of the client.

I have the permission of the client to publish the source code.

The source code is filled with commented out codes. I prefer commenting out changes to deleting changes.
